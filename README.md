sphinx-doc.el
=============

What is it?
-----------

``sphinx-doc`` is an emacs minor mode for inserting docstring skeleton
for Python functions and methods. The structure of the docstring is as
per the requirement of the
[Sphinx documentation generator](http://sphinx-doc.org/index.html).


Installation
------------

This package can be installed from
[MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/). To do so, run `M-x
package-list-packages`, then search for "sphinx-doc". Mark it with `i`
and finally press `x` to install.

To install manually, download and copy the `sphinx-doc.el` file
somewhere in the load path.


Configuration
-------------

Add the following line to your `.emacs` (or the equivalent config
file)

```elisp
    (add-hook 'python-mode-hook (lambda ()
                                  (require 'sphinx-doc)
                                  (sphinx-doc-mode t)))
```

This will enable the `sphinx-doc-mode` and bind the interactive
function `sphinx-doc` to `C-c M-d`.

If `(setq sphinx-doc-all-arguments t)` is added to `.emacs`, arguments
that start with an asterisk are shown in the docstring, e.g. `*args` or
`**kwargs`.


Usage
-----

Inside a Python file, move the cursor to some function/method
definition and hit `C-c M-d` (see gif demo below).


Demo
----

![Sphinx-doc](../master/demo.gif?raw=true)


Known Issues
------------

* When calling the function interactively, if the cursor is not on the
  head of a function definition (ie. the keyword `def`, function name
  or the parenthesized list of the formal parameters) it either shows
  a "search failed" message in the minibuffer or inserts documentation
  for a valid function definition closer to the current line! Although
  both behaviours are quite harmless, it's annoying and definitely
  needs to be fixed. Patches welcome!

* The [autodoc extension](http://sphinx-doc.org/ext/autodoc.html)
  needs to be enabled for the sphinx instance in order to generate
  documentation from the docstrings.

* If anyone's interested, there is a similar functionality I wrote to
  generate docstrings for Javscript functions based on the style of
  Natural Docs. It's not packaged as a mode but can be installed
  manually. [Natural Docs for Javascript in Emacs](http://naiquevin.github.io/naturaldocs-for-javascript-in-emacs.html)
